Instagram loves pie


Follow Pie is a tried and tested Instagram bot which automatically follows and likes users and photos based on certain parameters.

Made by @mutlu82 and @oh_moore with the goal of increasing more users for our personal accounts and driving people to view our profile pages which contains a url to our iPhone app

The aim of the bot is to get real people to reciprocate follows and likes.

The bot has several options -
Like
Follow
Set amount of photos to like
Set amount of people to follow
Set the time between each follow/like
Follow and like people who post photos to a certain hashtag, for example #London, will start the bot liking and following those users who have tagged their photo #london
Like and follow users who like photos on the popular page - this sets the bot running on users who have liked a photo on the popular page. The reason for this is because if someone has liked a photo on the popular page it is likely the are a active user and you'll get a quicker reciprocation.

Notes:

When this bot was written there was no limit on how many people you could follow, however it has since changed to 7500

There is also a API request limit of 5000 per second. However there's a limit of photos you can like per hour at around 200-300.

Our testing shows that it takes around 1000 likes to get 10 follows returned. Follow and liking is more powerful and returns better results (people are more inclined to return the favour)
